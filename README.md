# Generalized Readout Phase - DOES NOT WORK. 
This was the code for the PrePrint **"[Improving Graph Property Prediction with Generalized Readout Functions]()"**


**The experiments were not conducted appropiately (same protocol as the ones they were compared with). This results shouldn't be compared with the OGB Leaderboard. **
